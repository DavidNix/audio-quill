# Audio Quill

Transcribe WAV files and generate markdown files with titles using Whisper (locally) and OpenAI.

### Background:

I carry a low-tech ~$20 audio recorder when I go on walks to capture my thoughts and ideas. I leave my phone at home.

That way, I'm not distracted or tempted to check email, slack, discord, social media, etc.

Then when ready, I plug the SD card into my computer and transcribe the files.

I've been very happy [with this device](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CKRBSM1X?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details).

But audio isn't as useful as text. So this script turns them into text which I can organize later.

## Setup

You need an OpenAPI api key.

TODO

## Usage

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>

```
